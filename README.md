# so this is the project where im gonna be making my own API/Rendering Engine

yes its a graphics API and im gonna regret making it since it's like gonna be difficult but so far its going alright.

i've created a program that creates a pixel and it runs just well on linux, macOS, Windows, and any UNIX based operating system.

I'm making a triangle now and porting my API to OpenGL

### huh? this is working really well porting it to OpenGL
I've got a camera working now and my code is super duper good (it's only running at 400 FPS average)

# examples!! :3
no that isn't a speck on your screen, that is my first pixel! (for the millionth retried project)
