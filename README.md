# so this is the project where im gonna be making my own API

yes its a graphics API and im gonna regret making it since it's like gonna be difficult but so far its going alright.

i've created a program that creates a pixel and it runs just well on linux, macOS, Windows, and any UNIX based operating system.

# examples!! :3
no that isn't a speck on your screen, that is my first pixel! (for the millionth retried project)
